<h1> Mathematical modeling of tissue metabolism in response to malnutrition</h1>
<p>
Considering the complexity of the interactions between diet and child growth, it is difficult to get solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However, through the use of mathematical models it is possible to evaluate different hypothesis and hereby guide clinical studies such that they can answer key questions. Furthermore through the analysis of high-throughput clinical data in the context of mathematical models it will be possible to integrate different data formats and hereby enrich the information content in the data. We will therefore here propose a holistic approach for simulations of the metabolically active muscle, liver, bone and adipose tissues of the child and mother for devising new ecologically inspired strategies that can potentially be used to correct this metabolic abnormalities. In this context, we will first reconstruct simulation-ready genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for human bone and muscle tissue. During the reconstruction process, we will integrate different types of experimental data including proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics data. Next, we will predict the constituents of American, European and Malawian diets and ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) using our diet algorithm, as well as any kinds of data that are available through BMGF studies, e.g. metabolite levels in blood collected from children and mothers with and without malnutrition in response to these diet. We will use this information to model the metabolic differences of mother and child in health and malnutrition states, understand the complex system of interactions in their body, design studies and utilize core set of metrics across future studies. The pre-pregnancy and pregnancy of the mother will also be modeled in the same context. Using the analysis we will design therapeutic interventions by observational studies and predict the effects of the risks related to measures of malnutrition on mortality and the appearance of the different diseases.
