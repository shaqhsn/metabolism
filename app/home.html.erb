<h1> Mathematical modeling of tissue metabolism in response to malnutrition</h1>

<p>
The prevalence of maternal and child malnutrition is increased in low and middle-income countries and it results in substantial raise in mortality and overall disease burden. This devastating problem effects the capacity of the children and mother to achieve their full potential and manifest their suboptimal growth, neural development and immune dysfunction. This vicious cycle contributes to more than one third of all deaths worldwide in children younger than 5 years of age. In 2011, 165 million children under the age of 5 were stunted (26%), 101 million were overweight and 52 million were moderately or severely wasted. Malnutrition leads to a wide range of continuing health and developmental problems, possibly including cognitive impairment and metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The high mortality and disease burden resulting from these nutrition related factors make a compelling case for the urgent implementation of interventions to reduce their occurrence or ameliorate their consequences.
Malnutrition is not only caused by the food insecurity and it has a very complex intra and inter generational dynamic. Therefore, it is not straight forward to understand certain aspects of how we should live and which food we should consume to avoid the risks for malnutrition. Even though different research studies have investigated the cause of malnutrition, to our knowledge detailed mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon is not yet understood. Nutritional intake before pregnancy of the mother should also be accounted since a womanâ€™s nutritional status at the time she becomes pregnant influences her health during pregnancy and the health of her baby.
Considering the complexity of the interactions between diet and child growth, it is difficult to get solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms. However, through the use of mathematical models it is possible to evaluate different hypothesis and hereby guide clinical studies such that they can answer key questions. Furthermore through the analysis of high-throughput clinical data in the context of mathematical models it will be possible to integrate different data formats and hereby enrich the information content in the data. We will therefore here propose a holistic approach for simulations of the metabolically active muscle, liver, bone and adipose tissues of the child and mother for devising new ecologically inspired strategies that can potentially be used to correct this metabolic abnormalities. In this context, we will first reconstruct simulation-ready genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for human bone and muscle tissue. During the reconstruction process, we will integrate different types of experimental data including proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics data. Next, we will predict the constituents of American, European and Malawian diets and ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) using our diet algorithm, as well as any kinds of data that are available through BMGF studies, e.g. metabolite levels in blood collected from children and mothers with and without malnutrition in response to these diet. We will use this information to model the metabolic differences of mother and child in health and malnutrition states, understand the complex system of interactions in their body, design studies and utilize core set of metrics across future studies. The pre-pregnancy and pregnancy of the mother will also be modeled in the same context. Using the analysis we will design therapeutic interventions by observational studies and predict the effects of the risks related to measures of malnutrition on mortality and the appearance of the different diseases.
